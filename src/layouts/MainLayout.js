// The MainLayout.js is a component that acts like a template for all your pages. It usually includes things like:

// Header: The top part of the page with navigation links.
// Footer: The bottom section with extra info or links.
// Content Area: A space for each pageâ€™s content.
// It helps keep the page structure consistent and avoids repeating the same parts on every page.
